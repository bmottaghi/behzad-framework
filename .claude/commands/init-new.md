I'm initializing a new project with behzad-framework: $ARGUMENTS

**FIRST, read framework principles:**
> Note: Framework docs may be in root OR in .behzad/ folder (if installed as submodule)

1. Read: philosophy.md (or .behzad/philosophy.md)
2. Read: how-it-works.md (or .behzad/how-it-works.md)

**ASK ABOUT THE PROJECT:**
Before creating anything, ask:
1. What is this project about? (brief description)
2. Who are the target users?
3. What are the core features you want to build?
4. What tech stack do you want? (or should I recommend?)
5. Any specific constraints? (timeline, budget, compliance)

**AFTER CLARIFICATION, CREATE:**

**1. Basic project structure** based on tech stack

**2. docs/product-system.md**
- Product vision from user's description
- User personas from target users
- Feature backlog from core features (all Status: "Planned")

**3. docs/tech-spine/system-map.md**
- Proposed architecture
- Technology choices and why

**4. docs/tech-spine/data-model.md**
- Initial data model based on features
- Start simple, will grow

**5. docs/tech-spine/service-map.md**
- Planned services/modules
- API structure

**6. docs/tech-spine/decision-log.md**
- Document initial tech stack decisions
- Include rationale

**7. docs/tech-spine/test-strategy.md**
- Testing approach for this stack
- Coverage targets

**8. docs/execution/execution-plan.md**
- Empty template

**9. docs/learning/lessons.md**
- Empty template

**PRESENT:**
- Project structure created
- All framework documents initialized
- Recommended first feature to deliver
- How to proceed

**ASK:** "Project initialized. Use /new-request [feature] to start your first feature."
