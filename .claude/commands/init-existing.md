I'm initializing behzad-framework in this existing project.

**FIRST, read framework principles:**
> Note: Framework docs may be in root OR in .behzad/ folder (if installed as submodule)

1. Read: philosophy.md (or .behzad/philosophy.md)
2. Read: how-it-works.md (or .behzad/how-it-works.md)

**ANALYZE THE PROJECT:**
1. Explore the codebase structure
2. Identify: tech stack, architecture patterns, existing documentation
3. Find: entry points, main services, data models, tests

**CREATE FRAMEWORK DOCUMENTS:**

**1. docs/product-system.md**
- Document existing features as feature entries
- Mark all as Status: "Completed"
- Note any features in progress

**2. docs/tech-spine/system-map.md**
- Document current architecture
- List components and their relationships
- Note technology choices

**3. docs/tech-spine/data-model.md**
- Document existing data structures
- Schemas, relationships, key fields

**4. docs/tech-spine/service-map.md**
- List existing services/modules
- Document APIs and endpoints
- Note dependencies

**5. docs/tech-spine/decision-log.md**
- Start empty or document known past decisions
- Add decisions from README or comments if found

**6. docs/tech-spine/test-strategy.md**
- Document existing test setup
- Test commands, coverage targets

**7. docs/execution/execution-plan.md**
- Create empty template for future features

**8. docs/learning/lessons.md**
- Start empty for future lessons

**PRESENT SUMMARY:**
After creating all documents, present:
- What was discovered about the project
- What documents were created
- Any recommendations for improvement
- How to start using the framework

**ASK:** "Framework initialized. Ready to /deliver your first feature?"
