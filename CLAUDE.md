# behzad-framework

An AI-driven Product & Engineering Operating System for systematic feature delivery.

## Quick Start Commands

Type these commands directly in Claude Code:

- `/new-request [description]` - Start working on a feature or bug (AI detects which)
- `/init-existing` - Add framework to existing project
- `/init-new [name]` - Start new project with framework
- `/continue [ID]` - Resume paused work (FEAT-XXX or BUG-XXX)
- `/status [ID]` - Check feature/bug or project status
- `/help` - Show all available commands

> **Tip:** Use `/new-request` for anything - features, bugs, improvements. AI will classify and guide you.

## Key Documentation

Read these to understand the framework:

> **Note:** If installed as submodule, docs are in `.behzad/` folder.

- **philosophy.md** (or .behzad/philosophy.md) - Core principles (read first!)
- **how-it-works.md** - System architecture
- **deliver-flow.md** - The 9-phase delivery process
- **decision-gates.md** - The 5 approval points
- **command-guide.md** - Complete command reference

## Project Documents

Living documents that stay current:

- **docs/product-system.md** - Features and their status
- **docs/tech-spine/** - Technical architecture (5 files)
- **docs/execution/** - Current work phases
- **docs/learning/lessons.md** - Captured lessons

## Getting Started

1. Type `/help` to see all commands
2. For existing projects: `/init-existing`
3. For new projects: `/init-new my-project`
4. To start working: `/new-request user authentication`

## Framework Principles

1. **Intent-based** - Say what you want, framework handles execution
2. **Living documents** - Always current, never stale
3. **Decision gates** - AI stops for your approval at key points
4. **Phased execution** - Work is resumable
5. **Continuous learning** - Lessons prevent repeated mistakes

## About

This framework helps non-technical product leaders deliver features systematically using AI.
